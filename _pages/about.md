I am not an Epidimologist.  I am a Citizen Scientist.  I am a Data Nerd. I have extensive hands-on experience in a variety of technologies with a focus on enterprise data applications, high availability data systems, data security and signals intelligence, e-commerce systems, systems integration, advertising technology, digital media, data analysis, data mining, advanced machine learning, ensemble modeling, and more.
